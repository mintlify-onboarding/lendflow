Click on the Webhooks tab. To turn on a webhook notification, check the box next to the desired webhook and enter a url in the ‘link’ box. Optionally, to add another url ‘link’ for the same webhook (i.e. to get notified in multiple url locations), click the ‘+' icon and enter the url. Hit the ‘Save Template’ button to apply the changes.

## Application Progress Webhooks

This group is divided into two categories: Application status changes, and application stage transitions.

## Application Status Change

These webhooks fire whenever there has been a change in an application’s status. The application status change is not tied to a stage transition.

### Application Started

This webhook fires when:

<Card title="The applicant completes the first screen of the widget (excluding pre-qualification screens)" icon="window" icontype="duotone">
</Card>
<Card title="An application is created via the API" icon="square-terminal" icontype="duotone">
</Card>
<Card title="An application is duplicated" icon="clone" icontype="duotone">
</Card>
